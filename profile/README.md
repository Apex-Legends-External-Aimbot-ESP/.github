This is an external cheat for Apex Legends written in Rust. The cheat is embeddable, you implement the API to access Apex Legends and in return you get a bunch of features.

# Aim assist

## What is Apex Legends?

**Apex Legends** is a free-to-play, fast-paced Battle Royale and hero-shooter hybrid developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by EA. Players join teams of three and choose from a roster of “Legends,” each with unique abilities and roles. Matches emphasize squad synergy, mobility, environment awareness, and strategic looting within a shrinking play zone. It combines tight gunplay and traversal mechanics with distinct Legend powers, creating a dynamic and competitive experience.
